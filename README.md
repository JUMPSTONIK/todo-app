# Todo app

## Description
This is a classic todo-app. This was my first react project and the one that taught some of the fundamentals to start working with react and all the base technologies like CSS, HTML and Javascript

# Project deployed in Netlify

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can use the next commands to run the project locally:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
